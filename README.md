### Day 1 - Kickoff
On the first day we made our groups and started brainstorming about ideas. Bottom line, we're gonna make a website about our hobbies. Each individual page will be about that persons interest. The data we are gonna be sending over is most likely gonna be the name, profile picture, description and favorite animal of each team member. For my personal website I will make a page about my favorite movies. I will use the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API) to get the movies I want with all the data I need (movie name, poster, director, synopsis, IMDb rating etc.). For the micro-interaction I'm interested in making a carrousel with the movie posters. I wanna do this because I'm probably gonna have a bunch of movies that I wanna put on the page, so having a carrousel will be a nice way to display them all without it feeling crowded. I also want to be able to click on the poster which would then expanded to show some of the movie information (synopsis, director, rating etc.). We of course only HAVE to make one interaction, so I will put priority on just the carrousel, but I will try to make both if I can.

Here are some of the first sketches I made of my website:
